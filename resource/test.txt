Today, early in the morning, I woke up very late, so I rushed to school. I found I forgot to bring the textbook while the class began. I was so worried. At this moment, my classmate took out her book and asked me to share it with her. I was so grateful. After class, I went home and went to a shop to buy some snacks. As my turn to pay money, I couldn't find my wallet after searching every corner of my schoolbag. I must forget to take it away from home. Then the boss who was an old kind man asked me to pay next time. He said I was his frequent customer, so he trusted me. I felt so warm to hear nice words from him. My mistake in the morning made me have a hard day, but I met the nice people around me. I was so thankful to them.
